# SpotifyRedesign
### CECS 448 Project #2 - Group 1

The project's goal is to solve several usability issues with Spotify's UI observed during Project #1.
- Lack of clarity when adding songs to a playlist
- Difficulty navigating the albums page of an artist, especially for artists with a lot of releases.
- Lack of clarity when playing a downloaded podcast episode vs. streamed version.
